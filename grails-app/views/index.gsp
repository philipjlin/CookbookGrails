			<h1>CookBook Application</h1>
			<p>
				CookBook is a web application for a user to be able to create a virtual cookbook online filled with recipes.

				Recipes will be represented by objects and will include typical field one would find for any recipe, as well as tags for sorting and comments.

				Users will also have a virtual cookbook in which they can store recipes that they've created themselves or recipes on the site from other users that they like. The users will be able to add recipes that they like to their own cookbook when logged in when on a page that displays the recipes.

				The cookbook will have various lists such as course so that the recipes will be organized and accessible by those lists.

				There will also be a blog component to the site, which allows users a way to display all their recipes in a chronological style.

				The project provides authentication through the Spring Security Service.
